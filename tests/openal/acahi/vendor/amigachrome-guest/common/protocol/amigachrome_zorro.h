/* AmigaChrome's own Zorro manufacturer number, 0xDA15 (55829), the
 * AmigaChrome Team's from 1 October 2026. Before that the boards used 2011,
 * the number UAE and home-made test boards share (ShowConfig calls it "UAE
 * Amiga Emulator", Linux's zorro.ids "Hacker Test Board"). 0xDA15 is in
 * neither list.
 *
 * Products stay as they were: 1 ACBridge control, 2 ACStorage, 9 ACRTG,
 * 11 AC090's RAM.
 *
 * Drivers look for 0xDA15 first, then 2011, so one build works with either.
 * A boot ROM whose drivers do carries AMIGACHROME_ROM_MARK; the runtime
 * presents 0xDA15 to a ROM that has it (or AMIGACHROME_ROM_MARK_OLD, the
 * mark of a ROM built before the rename) and 2011 to one built before. */
