 * OGPU stream v1.2: the bytes every OpenGPU back end receives (DESIGN.md
 * section 5). v1.1 added A8 coverage masks for anti-aliased text and clip
 * paths (OpenGfx): the A8 format, MASK, and COMPOSITE's MASK, ADD and IN
 * flags. v1.2 (8 October 2026) adds what SDL 2's renderer and Warp3D need:
 * blend modes (as SDL's), FILL_BLEND, LINES_BLEND, POINTS_BLEND,
 * COMPOSITE_AFFINE (scale, rotate, flip, colour modulation), YUV, the
 * formats of real cards' screens, and the 3D range 0x0030-0x003F, whose
 * layouts are in stream3d.h (TRIANGLES serves SDL_RenderGeometry and
 * Warp3D alike). An older back end answers OGPU_NONE to OGPU_Query for
 * anything newer than it, so a program asks before it uses any of them. The 68k's own CPU back end, ACRTG.gpu on the Cradle and
 * PiStorm.gpu on a spare ARM core all read exactly this, so they draw the
 * same pixels.
 *
 * A stream is 32-bit words, big-endian (the Amiga's order) wherever it is
 * read. Each command starts with a header word: the opcode in the top 16
 * bits and the command's length in words, header included, in the bottom 16.
 * A back end that meets an opcode it doesn't know skips it by its length
 * and reports OGPU_ERR_BADOP, so newer streams fail one command, not all.
 *
 * Points and sizes are packed in one word: x (or width) in the top 16 bits,
 * y (or height) in the bottom 16, signed for points.
 *
 * Addresses are the Amiga's own. Each back end maps them to its memory: the
 * CPU back end uses them as they are, the Cradle through the guest's RAM
 * and video RAM, the PiStorm through Emu68's view of fast RAM.
 *
 * Pixels in memory are in the Amiga's byte order: RGB565 high byte first,
 * ARGB32 as the bytes A, R, G, B. Colours in commands are raw pixel values
 * in the target's format (a pen for CLUT8). */
