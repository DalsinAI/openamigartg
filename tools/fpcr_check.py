"""fpcr_check.py OBJDUMP FILE...: GCC 16's -m68040 float-to-int conversion
saves FPCR in a data register, sets round-to-zero, stores with
fmove.l fpN,<ea> and puts FPCR back. Sometimes it saves FPCR in the very
register <ea> indexes with, so the value lands in the wrong place (found
8 October 2026 by the SDL 2 helper: tiny_jpeg's JPEGs came out flat grey;
Mesa's feedback.c has one, in update_hit_record). -m68020 -m68881 and -m68060
convert with fintrz and don't do this.

This lists each such store and exits 1 if there is one, so a build can't
ship it. FILE is a program, a library or an object. (The same check as the SDL 2 helper's
library/modules/sdl2/fpcr_check.py, usable from other scripts: scan().)"""
